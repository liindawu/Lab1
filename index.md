## About Me

### Basic Boring Info

**My name is Linda Wu and I am a third year Computer Science major.**
>I also have a double minor in business and math.

*This is my favorite snippet of code:*
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

### Fun Factoids

**I strive to avoid falling trap to the stereotypical CS Major persona.**
In my free time, I ~~code~~ do my own nails and powerlift. Attached below is an image of one of my favorite set of nails that I did for myself. Currently, I can bench my body weight, squat over my body weight, and deadlift over twice my body weight. <sub>Unfortunately, with my courseload this quarter, my stats will probably go down. :(</sub>

### Quarter Goals

***This quarter, I am taking the following courses:***
- CSE 110
- CSE 135
- CSE 130
- CSE 150B

*To be able to balance this courseload, here are some goals I have for myself this quarter:*
1. Start meal prepping to eat healthy
2. Attend as many lectures as possible
3. Try to sleep before 1am every day
4. Set aside 1.5 hours each day to go to the gym
5. Plan my schedule using a calendar and map out when everything is due
6. Set aside at least an hour each day for extracurriculars that are not academic related

**Here is a mental checklist I go through before I approach a coding problem or am working with a group:**
- [ ] Identify the problem that needs to be solved
- [ ] Formulate a general approach to solving the issue
- [ ] Have approach approved or modified by teammates if applicable
- [ ] Write an outline of solution with psuedocode
- [ ] Write test cases and checkpoints to track progress and separate workload
- [ ] Allocate workload accordingly if applicable
- [ ] Begin coding!
