### Fun Factoids

**I strive to diverge from falling trap to the stereotypical CS Major persona.**
In my free time, I ~~code~~ do my own nails and powerlift. Attached below is an image of one of my favorite set of nails that I did for myself. Currently, I can bench my body weight, squat over my body weight, and deadlift over twice my body weight. <sub>Unfortunately, with my courseload this quarter, my stats will probably go down.</sub>

I also enjoy trying new food items and grocery shopping in Asian supermarkets. I went to my favorite spicy hot pot over Spring Break!
